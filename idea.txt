Teensy 3.2 + DFPlayer + ? bitlash ?

Serial not declared => '.c' -> '.cpp' (Cf .c doesn't support objects)


On RPI
 -> raspi-config : enable uart but disable loggin onto
 -> edit /boot/config.txt : ensure enable_uart=1
 -> reboot
 -> minicom -D /dev/serial0


On MCU bitlash

 - add echo( 0/1 ) user function
   - to enable/disable local echo on Serial & Serial1
   - if disable : only print( ... can send content to port
   - see : bitlash-cmdline.cpp :: byte putlbuf(char c) {
     - **done**



each cmd/instr always return a value (@ least 0 or 1)
 - even if not print( f ) ?? -
 - d1 = 1 => 1 -> ON the pin
 - d1     => 1
 - readK  => Hello

 - could have a look to https://github.com/geekfactory/Shell
 - is just a cmd/arg parser but very light

 (but can't even take String as arg)
 - else can see for a tiny BASIC

 - WANTED : 
   - if / for
   - cmd return an expression
   - analog/pwn
   - in/out/setDir
   - write/read to/from Serial(s)
   - read from keypad


use T3.2 as programmable GPIO + function/macro runner
