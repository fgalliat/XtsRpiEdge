ADDED cpp + fb code for demo
maybe could retry nes emulation w/ GPIO gamepad (old arietta code)
 -> will need ext. Screen 
 -> will have no sound
 -> but !GHz will be faster than arietta....

Teensy 3.2 + DFPlayer + ? bitlash ?

Serial not declared => '.c' -> '.cpp' (Cf .c doesn't support objects)


On RPI
 -> raspi-config : enable uart but disable loggin onto
 -> edit /boot/config.txt : ensure enable_uart=1
 -> reboot
 -> minicom -D /dev/serial0


On MCU bitlash

 - add echo( 0/1 ) user function
   - to enable/disable local echo on Serial & Serial1
   - if disable : only print( ... can send content to port
   - see : bitlash-cmdline.cpp :: byte putlbuf(char c) {
     - **done**

 - add DFPlayer support (RX2/TX2)

 - add another / aux. Serial port (RX3/TX3)

 - add MS chatPad ? // could be linked to auxSerial then activated or not
   - if need another (SoftSerial) port -> see SubMCU code + pinout



 - WANTED : 
   - analog/pwn
   - in/out/setDir
   - write/read to/from Serial(s)
   - read from keypad

 - https://github.com/billroy/bitlash
 - could have a look to https://github.com/geekfactory/Shell
 - is just a cmd/arg parser but very light

 (but can't even take String as arg)
 - else can see for a tiny BASIC
